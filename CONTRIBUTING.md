# Multimodal Deep Learning Paper Implementations

This repository contains educational implementations of influential multimodal deep learning papers. Each implementation includes a detailed walkthrough of the paper, code to reproduce the results, and explanations designed to help researchers understand both the theoretical foundations and practical implementation details.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

1. Provide accessible, well-documented implementations of important multimodal deep learning papers
2. Help researchers understand how to read and implement research papers
3. Create a valuable educational resource for the multimodal deep learning community
4. Encourage reproducible research practices

## Paper Implementations

### Financial Applications

- [**Multimodal Deep Learning for Short-term Stock Volatility Prediction**](papers/financial/sardelich2018volatility/) (Sardelich & Manandhar, 2018)
  - Predicts one-day-ahead stock volatility using both news headlines and price data
  - Introduces a hierarchical news relevance attention mechanism
  - Evaluates model performance across multiple market sectors

### Vision-Language Models

- [Paper Title] (Coming Soon)

### Audio-Visual Models

- [Paper Title] (Coming Soon)

## How to Use This Repository

Each paper implementation includes:

1. A **README.md** with a summary of the paper, key innovations, and results
2. A detailed **paper_walkthrough.md** explaining the methodology and architecture
3. Structured code in the **implementation/** folder
4. **Jupyter notebooks** for interactive exploration
5. Reproduced **results and visualizations**
